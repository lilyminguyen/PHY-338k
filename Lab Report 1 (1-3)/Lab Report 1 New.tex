\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank our laboratory instructor, Dr. Heinzen, and our teaching 
assistant, Kyle Gable, for their guidance and support through these labs.Their 
assistance and feedback were invaluable in helping us understand the experimental 
procedures and circuit concepts. We also appreciate the department's laboratory 
facilities and equipment, which made these experiments possible.
